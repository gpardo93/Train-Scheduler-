# Train-Scheduler-


This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It uses Firebase authentication to first login before viewing the train schedule. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
